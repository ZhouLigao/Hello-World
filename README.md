# Hello-World
This is my first Repository,feeling good!

but else is not very good.
I graduated from famouse university with so bad bad english writing skills.
half a year ago,i intentionally lost my job.
that means i quit the job which many people may like.
the leaders of that company try lots of ways to kill my idea,but it was too late.....
hahahah,wow!
that cool?
I am 32 years old now
but without a job.
i wanna find a job which i like
so, by a large chance
i meet you!

thanks!
